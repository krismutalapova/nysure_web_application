# Nysure
​
Nysure is an application that helps people gather all their different insurance and warranty information in one single place. The difference from other solutions out there is that Nysure prioritizes the items you want to keep safe, rather than just the policies you possess. For example, if you purchase a new item (e.g. a new mobile phone), you can create a card for this item, include the date of purchase, cost, and even photos of the item itself, no matter if an insurance or warranty policy cover it, or if it’s for simple filing purposes. With the quote function inside Nysure, the user can get quotes that compare several companies, and send claims directly to the appropriate insurance company. We work hand in hand with companies aiming at using new technologies to their full potential, in order to make their users’ experiences more effective, pleasant, and simple.
​
## Gathering insurance information
​
The general gathering of information will be available through forms to fill with the appropriate information, as well as file uploading (i.e. any type of file, such as picture and digital document conservation (contracts, receipts, item pictures, etc.)).
​
### Insurance policies
​
The user can register all their insurance policies, provided the company is our client.
​
The user will be able to select the appropriate company, enter the concerned policy ID, the type of insurance, the cost of this policy per year, and file uploading: any type of file, such as picture and digital document conservation (Digital contracts, receipts, item pictures, etc.)
​
### Receipts
​
The user can take pictures or scan their receipts, and upload them, no matter the origin of the purchase, therefore gathering all their insurance documentation digitally on Nysure.
​
### Item pictures
​
The user can store the pictures of items they purchased, with an insurance, simple included warranty or extended warranty, at any stage of the usage of the item.
​
## Quotes
​
The user is able to get quotes that compare several insurance companies.
​
They can choose to compare solutions for the following options: vehicle, home, child, pet, travel, life, health, and business.
​
The user fills in the appropriate form, and gets the prices from all the compared insurance companies, with categorised offers, depending on what options the user wishes to have.
​
## Claims
​
The user can send claims directly to the appropriate company they have registered an insurance policy for.

## Setup
For Mac

Our development environment for a full-stack web application will consist of three main parts:
​
1. Database (Postgres).
2. Backend server (Spring).
3. Frontend development server (React).
​
We will need to set up and start these three components in the order above for everything to work.
​
### Prerequisites
- Install `docker` and `docker-compose`.
- Install `Nodejs`.
- Install a proper IDE/Text editor fo Java and Javascript. IntelliJ community edition is recommended for Java development but doesn't work very well with JavaScript. It's therefore recommended to use VS Code or any other JavaScript-friendly IDE when working with frontend code.
​
### Starting the database
To start the database open the terminal and `cd` your way in to the project root folder. You can just simply run
`docker-compose up` to start the database. Closing the terminal will kill the database. So you need to restart the database every time you need to use it.
​
### Starting the backend server
Open the root folder in IntelliJ and import all the gradle dependencies (this has to be done only once of course).
​
Make sure that the database is running (see steps above) otherwise the backend won't have access to it. Then run the main class at `src/main/java/se/kth/sda6/skeleton/SkeletonApplication.java` to start the web server.
​
### Starting the frontend development server
To install the project dependencies for the frontend, open the terminal and make sure that the current directory is `frontend`. You can then run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed for the project (This has to be done only once).
​
To start the frontend server run `npm start` from the `frontend` directory. Make sure that database and backend server are also running so that the frontend can interact with the backend.
When working on the frontend, open the `frontend` folder in your favorite Javascript IDE.
​
## FAQ
### How can I connect to running database from terminal?
Sometimes you might want to inspect the tables, run raw queries, seed the database, check that a certain backend action has been performed correctly. To do that you can simply run the following command
​
 `docker run -it --network host postgres:11-alpine psql -h localhost -U nysure_user -p 5433 -W nysure`
​
 Use the password specified in `docker-compose.yaml`.
